# MDT_Final_Project

This is the final project for Managing Disruptive Technologies.

In order to execute the project the following needs to be done-
1. Download the entire package to your local desktop
2. Open the folders MarkerImages and QRCodes
3. Take a printout of the images and QRCodes
4. Open the individual apps via the android studio and install the same
5. Trigger the app called Pop Shop
6. Point to a QR Code and scan it
7. On scanning the app will open a camera window, at this point focus your camera on the markers. The augmented reality images will be displayed on those markers

PLEASE NOTE: Due to gradle versioning issues it is possible that android studio may not be able to compile the project. The individual apps need to be imported in Android Studio using ADT. Please avoid Gradle for this project.
